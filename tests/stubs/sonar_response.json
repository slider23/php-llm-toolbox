It is the largest city in the country and serves as the political, cultural, and economic center of France[1][2][3][4][5].\n\nKey details about Paris as the capital of France:\n\n- Paris has been the capital since 1944, after its liberation during World War II, with some interruptions in history such as during the German occupation when Vichy was the capital[1][3].\n- It is located along the Seine River in the north-central part of France, within the Île-de-France region[4][5].\n- The city covers an area of about 105 km² (41 sq mi) and has a population of approximately 2 million people as of 2025, with the metropolitan area housing over 10 million residents[2][4][5].\n- Paris is a global center for finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy, often called the \"City of Light\" due to its historical role in arts and sciences[2].\n\nThus, Paris is the historic and current capital of France, central to the nation's identity and functioning."
