Paris is located along the Seine River in the north-central part of France and is the core of the ÃŽle-de-France region. It has a population of over 2 million within the city proper and more than 12 million in the metropolitan area[1][2][4].\n\nHistorically, Paris became the capital of France in 508 under King Clovis and has remained so with only a brief interruption during World War II when the capital was temporarily moved to Vichy[1][3]. Today, Paris is renowned worldwide for its rich history, architecture, fashion, gastronomy, and as a major global center for finance and culture[1][2][4]."
